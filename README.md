## Partner Progress Report

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/achafetz/PartnerProgress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/achafetz/PartnerProgress)

The package is used to create the data output that underlies the ICPI Partner Progress Reports (PPRs) which are generated twice a quarter (initial and post-cleaning). Historically, the data was [created in Stata](https://github.com/achafetz/PartnerProgress/tree/master/Archive_Stata) and required slight tweaks every quarter. Starting with FY18Q1, the scripts were converted into a automated package. The output is then used to populate an Excel template via [VBA](https://github.com/achafetz/PartnerProgress/tree/master/VBA) and the reports are then posted to [PEPFAR Sharepoint](https://www.pepfar.net/OGAC-HQ/icpi/Products/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2FOGAC-HQ%2Ficpi%2FProducts%2FICPI%20Approved%20Tools%20%28Most%20Current%20Versions%29%2FPPR&FolderCTID=0x0120004DAC66286D0B8344836739DA850ACB95&View=%7B58E3102A-C027-4C66-A5C7-84FEBE208B3C%7D).

### Create the PPR dataset

1) Install the package

```{r}
#install
  install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("achafetz/PartnerProgress")
#load package
  library("genPPR")
```

2) Setup folder - [Clone this repository](https://github.com/achafetz/PartnerProgress/archive/master.zip) to your local machine to have most of the folder structure and some data. 

```{r}
#setup any missing folders
  initialize_fldr(projectname = "PartnerProgress", #don't change this line
                  projectpath"~/GitHub", #change to match where you want the project folder created locally
                  "RawData", "Documents", "R", "ExcelOutput", "Reports") #don't change this line
```

3) Download the current MER Structured PSNUxIM dataset from the [PEPFAR Panorama](https://pepfar-panorama.org). You will need to convert the txt file to an rds file prior to running this package (use `read_msd()` from [ICPI/ICPIutilities](https://github.com/ICPI/ICPIutilities#read_msd)). You should save the rds file in the `RawData` folder.

```{r}
#convert MSD from .txt to .rds
  devtools::install_github("ICPI/ICPIutilities")
  ICPIutilities::read_msd("~/Data/ICPI_MER_Structured_Dataset_OU_IM_FY17-18_20180515_v1_1")
```
If you want to run this with an inprocess dataset from DATIM Genie, you will need to [run the `match_msd()` function from `ICPIUtilities`](https://github.com/ICPI/ICPIutilities#match_msd) to have the correct file name and saved as an rds.

```{r}
#ALTERNATIVE: IF USING IN PROCESS DATA FROM DATIM
  devtools::install_github("ICPI/ICPIutilities")
  ICPIutilities::match_msd("~/Downloads/PEPFAR-Data-Genie-OUByIMs-2018-11-13.zip")
PEPFAR-Data-Genie-OUByIMs-2018-11-13
```

4) Create the PPR dataset - run the main script, `genPPR()` from the package to create the underlying dataset that feeds into the template

```{r}
#create global and OU output
  filepath <- "~/ICPI/Data/CPI_MER_Structured_Dataset_OU_IM_FY17-18_20180515_v1_1.rds"
  genPPR(filepath, folderpath_output = "~/ExcelOutput")
  
#alternatively, you can just create a specific OU output
  genPPR(filepath, 
         output_global = FALSE, 
         output_ctry_all = FALSE, 
         df_return = FALSE, 
         folderpath_output = "~/ExcelOutput",
         output_subset_type = "ou", 
           "Kenya")

#or generate "global" files that contain one or many implementing partners
  genPPR(filepath, 
         output_global = FALSE, 
         output_ctry_all = FALSE, 
         df_return = FALSE, 
         folderpath_output = "~/ExcelOutput", 
         output_subset_type = "mechid", 
           c("18045", "17097")
       )
#or just the global output
  genPPR(filepath, output_ctry_all = FALSE, folderpath_output = "~/ExcelOutput",)
```
